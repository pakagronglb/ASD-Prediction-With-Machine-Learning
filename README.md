## üìã Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioral traits and other relevant features. By analyzing patterns in patient data, the model helps identify potential ASD cases with high accuracy, potentially assisting in earlier diagnosis and intervention.

## üß© What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects communication, social interaction, and behavior in various ways. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention and support. This project aims to leverage machine learning to assist in the detection process by analyzing behavioral patterns and other relevant data points.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals with various behavioral and personal attributes, including:

- 10 behavioral features (A1-A10 Scores)
- Age, gender, and ethnicity
- Family history (jaundice, autism)
- Country of residence
- Screening app usage
- Screening score (result)
- Other descriptive features

The project uses the [Autism Screening Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamshinde123/autismprediction) from Kaggle.

## üíª How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook "Autism Prediction.ipynb"`
4. To use the pre-trained model:
   ```python
   import pickle
   # Load the model
   with open('best_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
       model = pickle.load(file)
   
   # Load encoders
   with open('encoders.pkl', 'rb') as file:
       encoders = pickle.load(file)
   
   # Prepare your data (X_new) using the same preprocessing steps
   # Make predictions
   predictions = model.predict(X_new)
   ```
